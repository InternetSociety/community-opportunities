Its results will define the UN's actions in the coming years, including how non-governmental stakeholders will be involved. The Internet Society will inform the intergovernmental deliberations with arguments that will defend the participation of all stakeholders, preserve the Internet as a force for good, and preserve its open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy nature.",
