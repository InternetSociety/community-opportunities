                    <title>Join the Global Encryption Coalition</title>
                    <link>https://www.globalencryption.org/join/</link>
                    <description>Some governments and organizations are pushing to weaken encryption, which would create a dangerous precedent that compromises the security of billions of people worldwide. Actions in one country that undermine encryption threaten all of us.

With over 400 members distributed across 103 countries, the Global Encryption Coalition promotes and defends encryption in key countries and multilateral fora where it is under threat. It also supports efforts by companies to offer encrypted services to their users.</description>
